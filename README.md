# About
It's basically just a password generator that you can use to secure your accounts or devices

# Revision
I made a revision today (January 6 2022) because I need this program for my college exam and just for fun

# How to use
You can either use the .exe file (Python3 must be installed probably, I haven't tested yet), or just use the source code directly
If you have any idea about this program, feel free to modify it. I might learn something from it
